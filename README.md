# Simple Sound Mixer for Roblox Studio

## What is it used for?

*This mixer is used to create sound channels, run sounds inside them, and manage channels.*

> For example:
> You need to play the sound of the atmosphere/music in the background at one time and at the same time have a channel for other sounds, but you want to be able to control and track each channel for sounds.
